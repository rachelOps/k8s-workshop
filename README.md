# Kubernetes Workshop: Deploying a WordPress Application

## Overview

In this workshop, we will deploy a WordPress application using Kubernetes, including the necessary database setup, ingress configurations, and monitoring tools.
This document outlines the installations, services, and their interactions, providing a comprehensive guide to the entire setup.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

# Installations:
- Minikube (To install Minikube, follow the official Minikube installation guide)
- kubectl (Install kubectl by following the official kubectl installation guide)
- Docker (if needed) Install Docker by following the official Docker installation guide
- Helm (optional for package management) If you are using Helm for managing Kubernetes applications, install it by following the official Helm installation guide)
- NGINX Ingress Controller To manage ingress resources, install the NGINX Ingress Controller
- Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim Define a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim in YAML to ensure data persistence for the MySQL database)
- Prometheus and Grafana (optional) To monitor your Kubernetes cluster: Follow the kube-prometheus-stack installation instructions)

# Summary
This workshop demonstrated how to deploy a WordPress application on Kubernetes, including setting up a MySQL database, ingress for external access, and monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus.
Each service communicates as follows:

- WordPress connects to MySQL using the database service.
- The NGINX Ingress Controller routes traffic from external requests to the WordPress service.
- Prometheus and Grafana monitor the performance of your application and cluster.
